# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition with MLP

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network trained on the classic MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The project demonstrates loading the original MNIST data files, visualizing sample digits, training a neural network classifier, and evaluating its performance through accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## Features

- Load MNIST dataset locally in original format
- Visualize sample handwritten digits from the dataset
- Train an MLP neural network classifier using scikit-learn
- Measure training and prediction times
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
