# Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming radiology by automating image interpretation and workflow tasks. This critical essay examines the current state of AI in radiological diagnostics by analyzing recent scientific studies, focusing on metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and comparisons between AI-assisted and human-only diagnosis. The review highlights AI's successes in improving detection rates for abnormalities like pulmonary nodules, pneumothorax, and breast cancer, while also addressing its shortcomings, including limited generalizability, false positives, algorithmic bias, and issues of explainability. Despite promising results—such as increased sensitivity and reduced reading times—challenges persist, particularly regarding real-world applicability and ethical considerations. The essay concludes that while AI holds great promise as a supportive tool for radiologists, caution must be exercised in its implementation. Future research directions emphasize the need for prospective, multi-center studies, improved data diversity, transparent AI development, seamless workflow integration, and continuous performance monitoring. Ultimately, AI should be viewed as an assistant complementing human expertise rather than a replacement, with the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes when used judiciously.
